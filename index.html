				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am an individual with a passion for learning and solving problems. This is why I have decided to join thinkful to become a software engineer. Life is complex and often very complicated, so I am committed to simplifying the human experience with the use of technology.</p>
				<p>I have spent most of my working life in the restaurant industry where until recently, most of the technology used has been fairly outdated. Though POS systems have caught up with the times, many systems within most restaurants are yet to be automated or improved via technology and I would like to implement some of my ideas to streamline many of these systems myself.</p>
				<p>Outside of my experience in the restaurant industry, I spent most of my life playing and coaching competitive soccer. Through that experience, I developed a strong desire to work within team environments where each individual is committed to the success of the collective unit, and is constantly pushing him or herself as well as those around them to get the best out of themselves and bring about constant improvement.</p>
